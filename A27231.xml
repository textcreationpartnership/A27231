            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A PREFACE To the Judicious and Impartial Reader.</head>
            <p>THE Piece lately put forth by <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> called,
<hi>Truth and Innocency Vindicated,</hi> might more properly have been ſtiled, Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy and Sedition palliated. We acknowledg the Charge, which the <hi>Brief Diſcovery</hi> gave, was high and home, and could not but affect them deeply; and therefore ſome Paint and artificial Colours muſt be procured to render their Doctrines at leaſt tolerable in the Eyes of the World; which how far they have done, the Reader will eaſily diſcern by the following Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. 'Twas hop'd, after we had given ſo many clear Inſtances out of their approved Authors, of ſeveral blaſphemous and ſeditious Principles maintained by them, that either the Citations would have been evidenc'd to be falſe and forged, or the Authors diſown'd, as to theſe Particulars at leaſt, and ſo the Doctrines being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious diſclaimed by them, which had been the only fair way of vindicating Truth and themſelves: But no ſuch matter, our Adverſary denys not but they are quoted truly, but only ſays they are perverted and miſtaken, or elſe maimed and imperfect (which is the uſual Artifice of this ſort of People) as if we did not underſtand the ſenſe of common Engliſh words, and know not what is meant by <hi>equal,</hi> or <hi>infinite;</hi> by <hi>a part,</hi> or <hi>the whole.</hi> Sure we are, that paſſage of a plain-dealing
<hi>Quaker</hi> had been a more proper anſwer, who ſays,
<q rend="margQuotes">They are no Blaſphemers, becauſe 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible<note place="margin">Shewen'<hi>s Treatiſe of Thoughts,</hi> p.
14.</note> they ſhould be ſo; they have not erred, becauſe 'tis impoſſible they ſhould, being infallible.</q> But 'tis pleaſant to hear them cry out, we <hi>put a wrong ſenſe upon their words,</hi> whilſt we have not offered to give any ſenſe of them at all, but barely recited them as we find them in their own Books: And had we quoted every word he charges us to have deſignedly concealed, we ſhould ſtill have been deafned with their clamours of diſingenuity and unfairneſs of Citations; there might always have been a pretence of ſomething left out, unleſs we had tranſcribed whole Leaves; which would have been infinitely tedious to any, but eſpecially to ſo auguſt an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly as the <hi>Brief Diſcovery</hi> was tendred to. But for all our Charge of their being guilty of blaſphemous and ſeditious Words, they mean as honeſtly as you can deſire; but we pretend not to know the meaning of their Authors, but of their Words. We had always thought Words had been the beſt Interpreters of our meaning, and that theſe ought to be taken according to the common and cuſtomary uſage of them in our Nation; and if ſo, we are ſure they import Blaſphemy and Sedition: 'twas not our work to inquire into the meaning of the Men, but of the words.<note place="margin">Here thou haſt ſhewed (<hi>ſaith</hi> Geo. Fox <hi>to his Adverſary</hi>) that the Quakers have a Spirit given to them beyond all the Forefathers (which we do witneſs) ſince the days of the Apoſtles in the Apoſtacy; and they can diſcern who are Saints, who are Devils, and who are Apoſtates, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeaking ever a word, they that be in the Power and the Life of Truth. <hi>Great Mystery,</hi> p. 89.</note> We have heard indeed that the <hi>Quakers</hi> have ſuch a Spirit of diſcerning, as can tell us Mens thoughts and meanings without their ſpeaking a word; but we pretend to no ſuch unerring Key, but judging by their words, we muſt declare them monſtrouſly blaſphemous and ſeditious. Again, we are told there are other words in the Authors we have cited, which were able to have ſweetned the Expreſſions we blamed,
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:102072:4"/> into Truth and Orthodoxy: But why may not thoſe ſeemingly Orthodox Expreſſions be as well interpreted by theſe we have quoted, as theſe be expounded by them, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince one who was lately of their own Communion, and ſo beſt knows their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, has averr'd, that notwithſtanding all their palliations and ſeeming agreeableneſs, they do not truly and rightly believe one Article of the Creed according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the true univerſal ſenſe of ſound Chriſtians in all Ages? (ſee <hi>G. Keith</hi>'s Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript to the
<hi>Serious Dialogue between a Churchman and a Quaker</hi>) Thus like the Hereticks of old, tho they uſed the ſame words with the Orthodox in the Articles of their Belief, yet they meant differently, yea ſometimes quite contrary to them, as <hi>Ireneus</hi> complains, <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 19. ult. <hi>Similia loquentes fidelibus, non ſolum diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilia ſapiunt, ſed &amp; contraria.</hi> But ſuppoſing this were ſo, will Orthodoxy in one place be an excuſe for Heterodoxy in another? 'Tis not their having ſpoken like Loyal Subjects yeſterday, will clear them if they ſpeak Treaſon to day. It muſt be acknowledged that <hi>G.

<hi>Julian, Porphiry,</hi> and <hi>Celſus,</hi> the keeneſt and moſt venomous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilers of Chriſtianity, by the ſame methods he has here uſed to clear thoſe, he may correct the poiſon of their Writings, and extract wholeſom Doctrines from the moſt peſtilent Expreſſions; for let him take but the liberty, as he has done here, of three things, and what ſhould hinder it? 1. To blot out part of a Sentence, as in <hi>p.</hi> 10. where
<hi>Fox</hi> ſays, <hi>He that hath the ſame Spirit that raiſed up Jeſus Chriſt, is equal with God.</hi> Now, ſays <hi>Whitehead, He that hath, ſhould be left out;</hi> and then indeed the Sentence is very Orthodox,
<hi>viz.</hi> The ſame Spirit that raiſed up Jeſus Chriſt, is equal with God. 2. To ſay they are confuſedly miſplaced, as <hi>p.</hi> 6. or the words<note place="margin">Brief Diſcov. <hi>pag.</hi> 5.</note> are to be tranſpoſed, as <hi>p.</hi> 19. <hi>Sol. Eccles</hi> tells us,
<q rend="margQuotes">It was ſaid of Chriſt, That he was in the World, and the World was made by him, and the World knew him not: So it may be ſaid of this true Prophet (<hi>Geo. Fox</hi>) whom <hi>John</hi> ſaid he was not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> Theſe words, ſaith <hi>Whitehead</hi> [whom
<hi>John</hi> ſaid he was not] we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own in that place, they are confuſedly miſplaced: to be ſure he was in great confuſion how to bring him off from being guilty of Blaſphemy, for ſaying, <hi>Fox</hi> was he whom <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> ſaid he was not, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Chriſt. And <hi>p.</hi> 19. <hi>Geo. Fox</hi> had ſaid to the Prieſt,
<q rend="margQuotes">Thou canſt not know Scripture, but by the ſame degree of the Spirit the Prophets and Apoſtles had. No, ſaith

25. when <hi>Fox</hi> had been charged (by the <hi>Brief Diſcovery</hi> p.

Whitehead,</hi> to vindicate him, ſays, that theſe Expreſſions wanted their due Points, and ſo puts the words, <hi>that was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,</hi> in a Parentheſis, thus, <hi>The Apoſtles preached Chriſt (that was crucified) within—and he that hath not this Chriſt (that was riſen and crucified) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, is a Reprobate:</hi> Thus altering the great intendment of <hi>Fox,</hi> which was to ſet their whole value upon Chriſt's being crucified and riſen within us, as is evident by many other Paſſages in their Writings; and believing ſure that no Perſon would
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:102072:4"/> ever look this Paſſage in <hi>Fox</hi>'s <hi>Great Myſtery,</hi> where 'twas objected againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> as their deluding poor Souls, to hold forth a crucified Chriſt within, riſen within, aſcended within, which indeed he anſwers in the next words orthodoxly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, tho nothing to the purpoſe of the Objection (no body denying that if Chriſt that's crucified be not within us, we are Reprobates) but within ſix lines after he has theſe Paſſages the <hi>Brief Diſcovery</hi> charges,
<hi>The Apoſtles preached Chriſt that was crucified within,</hi> &amp;c. Now, allowing this Sophiſtry, we defy any <hi>Turk, Jew,</hi> or
<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt,</hi> nay even the <hi>Devil</hi> himſelf, to utter ſo vile a Blaſphemy but that it may be made as Orthodox as the Creed. But let wiſe Men judg whether this ought to be allowed any Writer who undertakes to vindicate another, when by his confeſſion, if the words be read as they are, and have been printed for many and many years, the Author muſt be guilty of Blaſphemy. Great endeavours has he uſed in many places to vindicate himſelf and others from Blaſphemy (as where he ſays, <hi>That which is ſpoken from the Spirit of Truth in any, is of as great Authority as the Scriptures, and greater</hi>) but the beſt way he ever took was, when charg'd with that moſt blaſphemous paſſage againſt the Trinity, in a Book put out by him and three other <hi>Quakers,</hi> called, <hi>Iſhmael and his Mother caſt out;</hi> where they beſpeak their Adverſary thus: <hi>The three Perſons thou dreameſt of, which thou wouldſt divide out of one like a Conjurer, are all denied, and thou ſhut up with them in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual darkneſs for the Lake and the Pit. Geo. Whitehead</hi> does now expreſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own the words (tho they were juſtly chargeable upon him as well as the others, being Partner with them in the whole, and ſetting his Name, without any diſtinction, to the intire Book) affirming, that they are none of his, and that he wrote not that part of the Anſwer; and that he ſhall neither ſtand by, nor own theſe words, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This we are ſure is the beſt way he could take to vindicate himſelf, tho thereby he has left his three Brethren under this black mark of being Blaſphemers; for to ſay only, The words appear too raſh and irreverent, is handling the Ulcer too gently, which ought to be cut out to the very Coar. But if we may believe a great and good Man, <hi>Geo. Whitehead</hi> could not always thus excuſe himſelf in this particular, for the Reverend and Learned Dr. <hi>Falkner</hi> (in his Treatiſe of <hi>Reproaching and Cenſure,</hi> Part 2. cap. 3. ſect. 1. num. 5, 6. p. 265, 266.) tells us, That when he diſputed with <hi>Geo. Fox</hi> and <hi>Geo. Whitehead</hi> at <hi>Lynn Regis</hi> in the County of
<hi>Norfolk, Anno</hi> 1659, they ſent him nine Queſtions, or Poſitions rather; the firſt of which was againſt the three Perſons of the Deity: And in the firſt day they plainly declared themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the three Perſons of the Trinity, and then (ſays Dr. <hi>Falkner</hi>) I charged

            <p>But Blaſphemy, ſtrictly taken, denotes, 1. A ſpeaking evil or reproachfully of God. 2. A vilifying or ſpeaking contemptuouſly of thoſe things which have a peculiar relation to God. 3. An attributing to others, or an aſſuming to our ſelves, that which is proper to God alone.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A ſpeaking evil or reproachfully of God. That this (and the next par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular alſo) is Blaſphemy, that place, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 6. does evince. The Beaſt is ſaid to open his Mouth in Blaſphemy againſt God, to blaſpheme his Name, and his Tabernacle, and them that dwell in Heaven. And <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both</hi> was charged to blaſpheme God (1 <hi>Kings</hi>
21. 13.) to ſpeak evil or reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully of him. 'Tis true this, like other Crimes, admits of Aggravation and degrees of Guilt: for there is a Blaſphemy of impious outrage and downright defiance againſt God, ſuch as was that of
<hi>Rabſhakeh,</hi> openly denying the Power of the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as ſufficient to reſcue out of his Maſter's hand: Such that of
<hi>Mezentius</hi> in the Poet; <hi>Dextra mihi Deus, &amp; telum quod miſſile libro.</hi> And this ſort of Blaſphemy in an
<hi>Iſraelite,</hi> was that which, as we conceive, was puniſh'd with Death, <hi>Levit.</hi> 24. 11, 15, 16.</p>
            <p>Again: Blaſphemy againſt God may be charged upon Men, when from their avowed Profeſſions, Principles, or Practices, it follows, by clear Evidence, and unconteſtable Reaſoning, that the peerleſs Majeſty, Holineſs, Immutability, Truth, Unity, or other Perfections of God, are rival'd, vilify'd, injur'd or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prav'd; becauſe there is none Holy as the Lord, and becauſe in him is Light, and no Darkneſs at all. Thus, to aſcribe to God a ſinful Impulſe, or a lying Divination; to detract and derogate from his adorable Perfections, can never be excuſed from a deep Tincture of this dangerous Crime.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A vilifying or ſpeaking contemptibly of thoſe things which have a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar relation to God; as in the forementioned place,

               <p>When they ſpeak of the Inbeing of this Divine Light in Believers, we hope they mean ſomething peculiar to them, and not common to Beaſts, which is nothing but the Preſence of his Eſſence, and that is every where. We ſay then that Light which is in us peculiarly, and enlightens us, is but a Ray and Beam of that Eternal Light (as <hi>William Penn</hi> owns in many places) ſubjected in our minds; and to ſay that Light was not made is the Blaſphemy, that Light being manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinct from the Enlightner himſelf, as the Light in a Room is diſtinct from the body of the Sun. To ſay that Light which is in the Room ſubjected in the Air there, is the Sun in the Firmament, is egregious Folly; and to ſay thoſe beams of Light that are ſhed abroad in Mens Hearts and ſubjected there, are the very Eternal Sun of Righteouſneſs it ſelf, is Blaſphemy, ſeeing they are but an effect of it. Truth is, the Eſſence of God enlightens nothing as barely preſent with it; if it did, then every thing would be enlightened where it is (for a <hi>Quatenus ad omne valet Conſequentia</hi>) which is evidently falſe, but only where it actually effects and ſheds its Light; and where that is ſubjected (ſure they will not ſay that the Eſſential Light of God is ſubjected in our Minds, and ſo reduce him to an Accident) 'tis not poſſible for any Creature to underſtand or know any thing the more for God's being only preſent with it eſſentially, for then a Tree or a Brute wou'd be as knowing and underſtanding as Men are, but by ſomething God effects in the Underſtanding, and is ſubjected there, which muſt be made; and 'tis Blaſphemy to ſay the contrary.</p>

<q rend="margQuotes">God does not enlighten Trees and Beaſts by his Preſence with them, becauſe Trees and Beaſts are not in Man's Nature, nor in any capacity for ſuch enlightning.</q> Which is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly falſe: for every thing, tho not in a natural aptitude and fitneſs, is in a Capacity in relation to the Almighty and powerful Preſence of God, that implies not a Contradiction. How rationally is <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Aſs<note place="margin">Num. 22. 28.</note> taught to diſcourſe with and reprove his Maſter?

In like manner the Illumination of Believers is not from any ſuch Eſſential Preſence with us, but by that ſame powerful Operation of God upon the Souls of dead Sinners, whereby he rais'd up Jeſus from the dead, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 20.

Let the Reader obſerve that <hi>Geo.

If the Anſwer of <hi>Burroughs</hi> be indirect, and nothing to the purpoſe, the <pb n="9" facs="tcp:102072:9"/> Queſtion being of that very Man and his very Body; if his Anſwer, we ſay, was not direct, but ſhifting and ſhuffling to another point, as <hi>Whitehead</hi> intimates, when he ſays,
<hi>p.</hi> 7. he means he is only ſpiritually in Believers; tho we agree the Truth, we cannot allow the Honeſty of ſuch an anſwer; nor can <hi>George Whitehead</hi> juſtify this dodging in him, it rendring him more like a Jugler than a Diſputant. When you ask for your Mony again out of the Juglers Hand, be opens it, and ſhews you nothing but a Counter: The Queſtion was ask'd, Is that very Man, with that very Body, within you? His Anſwer is (as
<hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> tells us) he is in us ſpiritually, which no body queſtion'd, <hi>viz.</hi> by his Graces and Influences. We may ſee how loth
<hi>Whitehead</hi> is that <hi>Burroughs</hi> ſhould be counted a Blaſphemer. Well! for once we are content he ſhould paſs for a Jugler.</p>

<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel. of Divine Love,</hi> c. 49. 112.</note>
               </p>
               <p>He begins with the firſt Citation, where <hi>Fox</hi> ſays, the <hi>Soul</hi> is one <hi>Soul</hi> with God. Here <hi>Fox</hi> has but lickt up the Froth from the mouth of Mother <hi>Juliana</hi> in one of her Enthuſiaſtick raving Fits: She tells us,
<q rend="margQuotes">We are ſubſtantially united unto God, our Soul is oned to God; between God and the Soul there<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ch.</hi> 5. 12. 46. 105.</note> is right ought; God is its Maker, to whom it is oned.</q> But <hi>Whitehead</hi> cries out amain, Where's the Blaſphemy in this? He cunningly repeats a part of the<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ch.</hi> 56. <hi>p.</hi> 144.</note> Inſtance, which was an aggregate one, conſiſting of many parts; and then crows and triumphs, Where, where is it? Like him that hides the Body out of ſight, and ſhews only a Finger or a Thumb, and then cries out, Where is the Man? Tho we believe this ſingle Allegation out of <hi>Fox,</hi> if it were alone, would appear blaſphemous enough. We have carefully read the Scriptures, to the number of ten brought as Witneſſes, who yet ſay not the leaſt that the Soul is one Soul with God; only 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17. ſays, <hi>The man that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit.</hi> Now what an inference is this! becauſe a man, who is a Body of Fleſh and Blood, is one Spirit with God, which is not poſſibly to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood but he is one with him ſpiritually, therefore the Soul muſt be one Soul with God. We are one with God morally by Faith and Love, and other Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <pb n="10" facs="tcp:102072:10"/> of the Spirit; or federally one by Compact and Covenant, as the Wife and Husband: but one Soul ſpeaks a ſubſtantial Union with God. God and the Soul may be one (as explain'd before) nay in the ſame manner one Spirit, becauſe God is a Spirit; but God and the Soul cannot any ways be one Soul, becauſe God is not a Soul at all. Every good Man is one with God, but not one Man; and every good Soul is one with God, but not one Soul, becauſe God is neither a Man, nor a Soul.</p>
               <p>Thus we have conſidered this place by it ſelf, and diſcovered its Blaſphemy; let us now conſider it with the reſt of its Company, and you may ſee he means not a moral, but a ſubſtantial Union: He ſays the Soul is a part of God. (Then a part of God might ſin, and repent, and be pardoned, or if not, be damned beſides.) A part of God, we think, was never heard of, but in <hi>Fox</hi>'s Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy: He would have done well to have taught it to the Scholars of <hi>Cambridg</hi>

                  <hi>Whitehead</hi> vindicates <hi>Fox,</hi> where he ſays, the Soul is of God's Being:
<q rend="margQuotes">Of God's Being, ſays he, relates to the Breath of God, that came out from God, and not to the Soul; no, no, 'tis only the Breath of God, that came out of God, that is of God's Being.</q> Read but impartially the Citation, <hi>p.</hi> 273. <hi>Gr. Myſt.</hi>
                  <q rend="margQuotes">'Tis not horrid Blaſphemy to ſay the Soul is a part of God; for it, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Soul, came out of him (not the Breath of Life) and is of him.</q> And again, <hi>p.</hi> 100.
<q rend="margQuotes">God hath all Souls in his hands; and is not this which cometh out from God, which is in God's Hand, part of God?</q> He had ſaid immediatly before, our Souls are in God's hand, not God's Breath; and now, what was in his Hands muſt be a part of God. He complains of our diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity for leaving out what might have cleared the point; whenas we aver no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is left out of that Sentence which could ſerve his turn. He ſays plainly, <hi>p.</hi> 100. “that which came out from God, which God hath in his Hand, that Chriſt is Biſhop of, is not this of God's Being? Now we read that Chriſt is the Biſhop of Souls, never the Biſhop of God's Breath. After all, let <hi>George Whitehead</hi> tell us what is meant by the Breath of God: Does he think that God really breaths, or has Lungs to breath with? or is it only a Metaphorical Expreſſion? Is it an<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> more when
'tis ſaid, God breathed into Man the Breath of Life, than he ſpake the word, and it was made? (as <hi>Whitehead</hi> owns, <hi>p.</hi> 9. <hi>l.</hi>
25.) Speech being cauſed by the Breath, and that is no more than a will to create: And it would have been the ſame, if he had ſaid, he breathed a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Sun or Moon, they being both created by his powerful Word or Breath, as well as the Soul. Now this Will or Word of God we doubt not but is God's Being, for it is himſelf; but this Will of God, can it be ever ſaid, it came out from God, or was in the hand of God, or that Chriſt was
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102072:10"/> the Biſhop of it? Can any thing that is God, as the Will, the Word, or the Breath of God is, come out of God? as if any thing of God could be divided or ſeparated from God. And tho a Creature may be ſaid to come from God, as an effect of his Wiſdom and Power, which yet is an impropriety of Speech, tho tolerable enough; yet to ſay that which comes out from God, is a part of God, of God's Being, as <hi>Fox</hi> does, is rank putid Blaſphemy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whitehead</hi> ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 9. <hi>l.</hi> 19. his Friend ſpeaks plainly in another place; and what is that to the Blaſphemy he has ſpoken in this? Would you have a man blaſpheme in every Line he writes? that were to outdo the great Blaſphemer himſelf, who ſometimes drops a Truth, tho it ill becomes the Father of Lies. We know no Amulet or Charm, no, not his pretended Infallibility he ſo much boaſts of, could ſecure that Prophet from ſpeaking Inconſiſtencies or Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions ſometimes; neither can plain Blaſphemy in one place, be excuſed by plain Orthodoxy in another. Is it ſuch a matter for <hi>Quakers</hi> to be inconſiſtent, as their Tutor was? to ſay ſometimes, thou art the Son of the Living God, and ſometimes, if thou be the Son of God. There is a ſpiritual Lunacy that poſſeſſes <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſo that they ſpeak Orthodoxly by fits; they are not always in the raving mood of Blaſphemy, tho the mad fit was upon <hi>Penn</hi> and <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> (in the <hi>ſandy Foundation,</hi> and in <hi>Light of Life</hi>) againſt the Trinity and the outward Blood; when their Moon, their Light within them, was at the Full: that Light waining now apace, they begin to ſpeak ſoberly of both. To ſay then he could not ſpeak Blaſphemy in one place, becauſe he is Orthodox in another, is idle and inconſequent.</p>

               <p>Ah <hi>George!</hi> Thou ſaweſt it well enough, and that it was too evident a Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy to be excuſed; but Friends muſt not fall out, and call one another Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers, tho they be ſo. But give us leave to ſtop thee in thy haſt; and when thou haſt read it once more, tell us upon the new <hi>Quaker</hi> Oath, <hi>As God is thy Witneſs,</hi> whether thou thinkeſt ſuch words as theſe to be blaſphemous, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Soul is without beginning and infinite in it ſelf, and by conſequence God. Why then doſt thou not yield up thy Friend and Apoſtle to be bored through the Tongue for a Blaſphemer? Two things we may take liberty to conclude from thy ſilence: 1<hi>ſt.</hi> That <hi>George Fox</hi> for once has been convicted of Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and therefore we may call him a Blaſphemer upon a <hi>nihil dicit.</hi> And 2<hi>ly,</hi> That when he ſaid the Soul was one Soul with God, he muſt mean ſubſtantially one, becauſe he makes it without beginning, and infinite in it ſelf, that is, the ſame with God.</p>

<hi>George,</hi> to be ſure thoſe words are found printed there, and have been ſo this 40 years, and not only in <hi>Fox</hi>'s life time, but view'd and review'd by the ſecond day's Meetings, and never yet amended or corrected, tho now when a more diligent ſearch is made into your Principles, theſe words are diſown'd and rejected; as ſtoln goods are thrown away by the cunning Thief, when the hue and cry is cloſe at his Heels.

<hi>Francis Howgill</hi> very ingenuouſly<note place="margin">P. 232.</note> owns that they are <hi>Fox</hi>'s, and is ready to fall fowl upon
<hi>Whitehead</hi> as well as his other Opponents (calling them even Beetles and Owls) for ſtumbling at ſuch a Straw: The firſt thing thy dark mind ſtumbles at, ſays <hi>Howgill,</hi> is, that ſome have ſaid (it ſeems
<hi>Fox</hi> had Company with him) <hi>He that hath the Spirit of God is equal with God;</hi> and he labours to confirm it by adding, he that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit, there is Unity, and the Unity ſtands in equality it ſelf: <hi>Silly Creatures, and blind Buzzards,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to be offended at ſo light, ſo trivial a Blaſphemy.</hi> We expected
<hi>Whitehead</hi> would have given <hi>Howgill</hi> a ſharp rebuke for ſo bold a Reflection; no, he paſſes it over without any notice, for Friends muſt not fall out for a hard word or two; but when he labours to clear
<hi>Howgill,</hi> whom we cited as juſtifying <hi>George Fox</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, he with great ſincerity leaves out the firſt part of the Quotation, <hi>viz. The firſt thing thy dark Mind ſtumbles at is, that ſome have ſaid, that they that have the Spirit of God are equal with God;</hi> and begins, <hi>He that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit; there is Unity, and the Unity ſtands in Equality it ſelf</hi>—there is Equality in Nature, tho not in Stature. Here, ſays <hi>Whitehead,</hi> the Equality is placed between the Father and the Son, as the Union is between him and them: A moſt evident Falſhood! ſuch an one as if he has not <hi>Aes triplex circa pectus,</hi> his Conſcience muſt feel Remorſes for. Do but read the Words, <hi>He that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit:</hi> Is not the Unity here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Lord and him that is joined to him? Is not here the Unity? and is it not this very Unity that is the Unity between God and Believers, which ſtands in Equality it ſelf? Or elſe how would he have vindicated <hi>Fox</hi>'s words, which he undertook to do, and by conſequence calls <hi>George Whitehead</hi> as good as Fool for ſtumbling at them? It would not anſwer the Deſign of <hi>Howgill,</hi> which was to prove a good Man was equal with God, only to prove God the Father and God the Son are equal. Where
<hi>Howgil</hi> ſays there is equality in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, tho not in Stature, hear what <hi>Whitehead</hi> ſays to this, The Equality in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture relates to the Divine Nature, which the Child of God partakes of in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102072:12"/> of Knaves: when he ſaid Equal, he meant not Equal; when he ſaid Infinite, he meant not Infinite; when he ſaid a part of God, he did not mean a part of God: ſo that we muſt read him as we do <hi>Hebrew,</hi> backwards This is a common muſe <hi>Whitehead</hi> has made for the

               <p>AND now for Infallibility, the grand Sinew of Quakery and Popery too; and if we can but ſhake this Pillar, we certainly pull down the Houſe upon the Heads of theſe <hi>Philiſtines:</hi> we ſay then, this is an Attribute incompatible with a Creature, even Angels in Heaven; for ſome of them have fallen, and that all do not ſo, is not to be imputed to the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their created Beings, but to the Will and Counſel of God eſtabliſhing and upholding them; and 'tis Blaſphemy for any Creature to aſſume this unto it ſelf; and that it is ſuch an incommunicable Attribute, is thus proved. If Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility be the higheſt Perfection of the Underſtanding, to which nothing imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable can be added, then it muſt be an incommunicable Attribute of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it is ſuch a Perfection, for it implys an impoſſibility of erring, therefore it muſt be an incommunicable Attribute of God: for he that hath ſuch a Perfection, hath an infinite One; for nothing that is finite, but may have ſomething added to it in point of Perfection; for God never acted yet <hi>ad ultimum virium,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath he made any thing ſo perfect in any kind, as he could: this were to ſay that Infinite Power could be exhauſted, which were a contradiction, for then
'twould not be Infinite. Truth is, God gives no more Infallibility to the Chriſtian, than the Sun does to the Traveller, who notwithſtanding its cleareſt Light may err and wander if he will. That they attribute Infallibility to themſelves, appears by what <hi>Fox</hi> ſays in his
<hi>great Myſtery</hi> (as the <hi>brief</hi>

<hi>George</hi> ventures to vindicate; and firſt he complains<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 11.</note> we leave out material Queſtions; let's hear what they are, He that is not infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible in his Counſel, Judgment and Advice, is not he in Error? which amounts to this Propoſition, Every One that is not infallible, is in Error: and if this were true, we own there muſt be an Infallibility amongſt good Men, or there would be none ſuch; this only wants a little truth in the Conſequence, that if not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102072:12"/> then in Error; either we muſt be Scepticks, or Gods; knowing nothing certainly, for all things infallibly. The following queſtions cited by him are of the ſame import, and confirm what the <hi>Brief Diſcovery</hi> charges upon <hi>G. Fox.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now let's hear how <hi>Whitehead</hi> vindicates him, and evidences our great Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he charges us with herein; he makes it a wonderful Error in us, and a Conſequent of our Principle to maintain theſe four contrary Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the Holieſt Man is not able to give an infallible Character of another Man: <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s Aſſertion was, that every Miniſter of Chriſt is able to give an infallible Character of another Man; which tho we deny, yet 'tis not conſequent we muſt hold that none does (even the holieſt of them) becauſe we deny every Man is wiſe and virtuous, therefore we muſt hold there is none ſo. But to let go the Conſequence for once, becauſe we will have no more wrangling than needs muſt, we will come to the Propoſition, and ſay as the Prieſt did to
<hi>G. Fox,</hi> That the holieſt Man that is, is not able to give an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Character of another Man; and for this Reaſon, Becauſe the holieſt Man alive is but a Man, and cannot be veſted with the incommunicable Attribute of the Deity, which is to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, there being no certain, much leſs infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Character to be given of a Man, but from the Lineaments of his Heart. We deny not but God may reveal to Perſons the Hearts of others, and they may declare it to the World, as St.
<hi>Peter</hi> did concerning <hi>Ananias;</hi> but he gave<note place="margin">Acts 5. 3, 4.</note> ſufficient evidence, that God had revealed it to him by the miraculous death of <hi>Ananias,</hi> and upon that account his Declaration ought to be believed. But muſt we therefore credit every Gipſy or Fortuneteller, who pretends to give Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as well as any? Nay further, when God revealed to <hi>Balaam</hi> ſuch glorious things which he declared, was he ever the more infallible for publiſhing an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Declaration?</p>
               <p>The ſecond Propoſition he charges us with as a Conſequence of the former Principle, is, That tho a Miniſter of Chriſt cannot give an infallible Character of another Man, yet he may miniſter to his condition; which is certainly true; and he may ſafely do it to all. For the clearing of which, let us diſtinguiſh upon the ſtates of Men.</p>
               <p>Firſt, There is the general State of all Men, which is to be by Nature Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Wrath, of Diſobedience, Enemies in their Minds to God; this we certainly know, becauſe 'tis revealed to us by the Scriptures, tho we do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the particular ſtate of that Man whether he be ſtill in that ſtate of Enmity: and it will be granted ſure, we may miniſter to his Condition, by acquainting him with the methods of Reconciliation from Scripture, and with all manner of Arguments thence to his hopes and fears, to perſwade him to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Terms of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As for the States of Men in particular, and that in reference either to Doctrinals or Practicals, we may miniſter to them in either.</p>
               <p>Firſt, As to Doctrinals, whether they be falſe Teachers or true, 'tis evident we may certainly know, or elſe why are we commanded to try the Spirits? which ſhews, they may be diſcerned of what ſort they are, tho Satan does never ſo much transform himſelf into an Angel of Light: and that ſome have not the Spirit of God, whatſoever they boldly pretend, we are aſſured in that <pb n="16" facs="tcp:102072:13"/> the Scripture has revealed it to us; they <hi>ſeparate themſelves, having not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſ. 19.</note> ſays St. <hi>Jude.</hi> So that we may diſtinguſh betwixt a Man of God and a dreamer of Dreams, between a
<hi>Theopneuſt</hi> and a <hi>Demoniack,</hi> a real poſſeſſor of Divine Revelation, and a fantaſtick pretender to it. And if God ſhould give him ſuch immediate Revelation as he did to the Apoſtles, with an intent to oblige others to believe it, God will atteſt it by ſuch miraculous Operations as the Apoſtles were enabled to perform, which are ſure Evidences of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie Comiſſion, that they do not run before they are ſent; and like the fooliſh<note place="margin">Ezek. 13.</note> Prophets in
<hi>Ezekiel,</hi> follow their own Spirit, and propheſy out of their own hearts, ſaying, <hi>The Lord ſaith,</hi> and the Lord hath not ſent them. And ſure we may miniſter unto theſe, as we do now to <hi>Quakers,</hi> convincing them of their Errors, and reprehending of their Blaſphemies.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As to Practicals, we, alas, too certainly know of many that are in a very evil ſtate, being common Liars, Drunkards, Whoremongers, Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe the Scripture reveals it to us, that
<hi>ſuch ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> and ſure we may miniſter to ſuch Men, by uſing the ſame Arguments to their hopes and fears as before. But there are a ſort of People who pretend to be
<hi>Children of Light, Sons of God,</hi> that are yet Baſtards, and not Sons; many a Wolf that lurks under a Sheep-skin: ſo that the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance can give us no certain Rule to judg by, and we can look no further, nor can we certainly know whether he be a Sheep or a Wolf, Devil or Saint, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Revelation: the Apoſtles themſelves could not diſcern a <hi>Judas,</hi> tho our Saviour could; nor the <hi>Quakers</hi> a wanton <hi>Atkinſon,</hi> till a great Belly reveal'd it to them. Yet we can miniſter to their Caſes too, we can preſs upon them a ſincere and univerſal Holineſs, we can ſhew them the danger of Hypocriſy. Thus we can miniſter unto all, tho we know not certainly, much leſs infallibly, every Man's Caſe, till it be revealed to us. We deſire to know of <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> if a Perſon ſhould come to him with a troubled mind, how he could diſcern, by the help of his Infallibility, where it pained or pinched him, unleſs he opened his Condition, and told him the cauſe of his Grief; and yet if he were ſullen, and would not, he might miniſter Advice and Counſel to him. In none of theſe Caſes, can we reach further than a certainty, far from a
<hi>Quaker</hi> Infallibility; and in every Caſe, where we have not ſo much as a certainty, ſtill we may and ought to miniſter.</p>
               <p>The Third Propoſition. We own, That a Miniſter that is fallible, is in the Spirit a Miniſter of Chriſt, tho he cannot diſcern another Man's State and Condition, ſo as to give an infallible Character of him. The Apoſtles were Miniſters of Chriſt, and yet could give no ſuch infallible judgment of the ſtate of one amongſt themſelves, and therefore cry, <hi>Maſter, Is it I?</hi> and intreat their Maſter, who alone could do it, to diſcover the Traitor. Neither can the moſt infallible
<hi>Quaker</hi> of them all, infallibly tell whether <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> himſelf he a right-bred <hi>Eagle Quaker,</hi> tho now liſted into the number of their Apoſtles. One would imagine by his late coined Creeds, he were about to <hi>Keithize</hi> and warp from his antient Teſtimony, which God Almighty grant, and is the worſt harm we wiſh him; neither would it be any diſhonour to him to become an Holy Apoſtate, which the Apoſtle exhorts every Chriſtian to be, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, let him depart from iniquity.</p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:102072:13"/>
               <p>The fourth is uſhered in with a conſequently; and therefore now, if ever, we ſhall have a Conſequence, yea verily ſuch an one which as naturally flows from our Principles, as the <hi>Tyber</hi> from the
<hi>Thames;</hi> 'tis this, Becauſe the holieſt Man alive does not infallibly know a Man's ſpiritual State, he muſt not only be falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but uncertain in his Miniſtry. If we be fallible, we muſt be uncertain, a Conſequence evidently falſe and fooliſh; for a Man may be certain by his ſenſe and knowledg, not from the Infallibility of the Faculties, but from a rational Evidence that in the preſent Caſe he is not deceived.
<hi>Whitehead</hi> in this agrees with his Brother <hi>Penn,</hi> who in his Anſwer to <hi>Faldo,</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 36.</note> 
                  <hi>know, knows nothing certainly.</hi> They would fain make Certainty and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility the ſame thing, which are vaſtly different: Certainty is an Affection that belongs properly to an Act of the Underſtanding, Infallibility to the Power and Faculty it ſelf; and there is ſtill ſuch an Imperfection in the Power and Faculty of our Underſtanding, that it might poſſibly have been deceived, even in thoſe things wherein we are certain it hath not actually been deceived; and our Certainty that we are not deceived, doth not ariſe from the Infallibility of the Power or Faculty, but from hence, that we have all the Reaſon in the World to believe, that in the preſent Caſe our Faculties have not deceived us. <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> at the Cloſe of this Principle, makes it conſequent, that we are not only rendered hereby fallible and uncertain, but blind and ignorant of the ſtate and condition of others: How far ignorant of Mens States, we have ſhewn before, but by his leave not quite blind.</p>
               <p>He ſays he aſcribes this Infallibility originally and principally to the Spirit<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 12. l. 18.</note> of Truth (<hi>one would have thought it might have been wholly</hi>) which as it is it ſelf infallible, ſo is the teaching of it, <hi>ſaith he.</hi> Yes verily, the Spirit's teaching is very infallible; but is he ſure that every Man alive, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ay that any Man alive does infallibly follow the Spirit's Teachings? is it impoſſible it ſhould be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe? It muſt be therefore a wonderful Opening in <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> to tell us, That <hi>ſo far as we are led by the Spirit, we are aſſured by it, and led into ſound Judgment, Certainty, and full Aſſurance,</hi> &amp;c. Whenas the difficulty lies here, to prove that fallible Creatures do at any time infallibly follow the Spirit's Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: neither can we take it for Goſpel what Prophet
<hi>Parnel</hi> ſays, That <hi>whoever</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 23. l. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>are guided by the true Light, cannot walk contrary to it;</hi> no more than he that is guided by the Light of the Sun cannot ſtumble nor ſtagger tho he ſhuts his Eyes, or be drunk: unleſs he means they that follow the guidance of the true Light cannot but follow it, while they follow it; an Identical Propoſition, which Fools aſſert, and no wiſe Man can deny.</p>
               <p>Again, he adds,
<q rend="margQuotes">If there be no diſcerning of Spirits, no infallible Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter<note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 12. ult.</note> to be given of Men, then Chriſt's Sheep may follow Strangers, Dogs, Wolves.</q> Alas, poor Sheep, that cannot diſcern the Shepherd from his Dog. If they will conſider, the Sheep may know a Shepherd, if he be rightly called, and miniſter to the Sheep according to the Inſtructions of the chief Shepherd of the Sheep: They may be true Shepherds in relation to their Flocks, tho in relation to God they may be Wolves, and ſo reckoned at the laſt Day; but the Sheep ſure may hear ſuch a ones Voice, and follow ſuch a Conduct, tho the men be wicked and ungodly, whilſt their Doctrin is true. 'Twas our Saviour's direction to the Multitude, and to his Diſciples alſo, concerning the Scribes and <hi>Phariſees</hi> (who were the wickedeſt of men)
<hi>Whatſoever they bid you obſerve,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 23.
3.</note> 
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:102072:14"/> 
                  <hi>that obſerve and do; but do not ye after their Works.</hi> There was once a Wolf in Sheeps clothing (as they will acknowledg) amongſt themſelves, whom they thought to be very inſtrumental in bringing many out of our Darkneſs into their Light, while he taught men to follow the Light as the only Rule, and ſtoutly declaim'd againſt an imaginary God, and a carnal Chriſt beyond the Stars. Oh how they flock unto him by ſhoals! Poor Lambs! how they ſuck at the Breaſts of this Wolf, as at their own natural Dam. For all their inward ſenſe and inſtinct, they run bleating after him for ſpiritual Food and Refreſhment, being deceived by the Sheepskin Covering that he wore: His Wenching and Fornicating, which were the Wolf in him, were not diſcovered till ſome time after.
<hi>Leeds,</hi> in his <hi>Trumpet ſounded,</hi> p. 64. tells us of a counterfeit <hi>Quaker,</hi> who, tho a ſilly Woman, could put a cheat upon their pretended Spirit of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning how ſhe travel'd from Meeting to Meeting through ſeveral Countries, and held forth moſt powerfully, and was entertained by Friends as a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to their great refreſhment and admiration, and never diſcerned to be no Quaker, till diſcovered by others: So that now they admit none to travel upon Truth's account without Certificates. <hi>Whitehead,</hi> in his <hi>Quaker plainneſs,</hi> tells us they have a record in peoples Conſciences; but now they muſt have a record in their Pockets too, or their Friends will not receive them upon a Conſcience-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. Who doubts but <hi>Judas</hi> was wicked enough? yet the people might hear him and follow him, whilſt in his Doctrine he followed the Inſtructions of his Maſter: Nay, there is no doubt he might convert ſome by his Miniſtry, and they receive Nouriſhment from this Wolf (as
<hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Renues</hi> from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) ſeeing the efficacy of the Miniſtry depends not ſo much on the worth of the Miniſter, as upon God's Grace. Far be it from us to plead for the profane and ſcandalous; we could heartily wiſh there were no more of ſuch Wolves in the Church than there are of the other ſort in the Kingdom, becauſe (tho God may cooperate with the Miniſtry of ſuch, if their Doctrine be according to Truth and Godlineſs) yet he does not ſo uſually do it, unleſs their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be accompanied and enforced with the viſible Doctrine of a holy Life. Remember
<hi>Judas</hi> was one of the Twelve ſent out by Chriſt to gather a Church; and it were an impeachment of the Divine Wiſdom to ſay he made choice of an<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2. 17.</note> Inſtrument which was no ways fit for the work. As for the two Scriptures<note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 1.
5.</note> which he produces, when he tells us what he brought them for, whether to prove Infallibility or Tranſubſtantiation, we will return an anſwer.</p>

But all this while, tho Chriſt in executing Judgment be every where infallible in judging or diſcerning, how proves this the Saint is ſo, in whom he is? But perhaps he means, every Saint muſt be infallible in his Judgment, having ſuch an infallible Director and Mover within him: But the Lameneſs of this conſequence is ſhewn before; it will be ſtill with us as with our Watches, tho the Spring be never ſo ſtrong and good, yet by reaſon of ſome Cracks and Bruiſes it got by the fall, there may be ſome Errors and Stops in the motion even of this Maſterpiece of the Creation, which was at firſt ſo fearfully and wonderfully made by God.

               <p>'TIS the uſual Sophiſtry of this People to cover their Errors under ſome equivocal Expreſſion or other.

Eccles</hi> told <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> Paptiſm and the Lords Supper, O what an eſteem have they for them! But they do not mean what you and we and all the World beſides underſtand by them; but a ſpiritual Baptiſm, and a feaſting with Chriſt in the upper Room of the Heart. They own the Saints Union with Chriſt: but then 'tis not a moral or federal Union, but a ſubſtantial one. Every Chriſtian owns Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a right ſenſe, as far as is conſiſtent with our preſent ſtate: the <hi>Quakers</hi> own the word as well as we, but then 'tis in a ſenſe incompatible with our human frailty; a ſinleſs one, free from the leaſt failing and infirmity. As <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs</hi> ſaith, God doth not accept any, where there is any failing; a Condition unattainable in this Life. Where a word is equivocal or ambiguous, and hath <pb n="23" facs="tcp:102072:16"/> two Senſes, as Perfection hath in the Scripture, we would ſain know why it ſhould not be underſtood in that ſenſe which agrees with univerſal Experience, rather than in that which contradicts it. Let us ask the boldeſt <hi>Quaker</hi> of them all, dare he come ſtrutting forth with the bragging Phariſee, <hi>God I thank thee I am not as others are,</hi> the Men of this World; I am as pure, as ſpotleſs as the holy Angels themſelves; when I have ſearched every corner of my heart, I cannot find the leaſt Sin to be lamented; the whole Day, Month, or Year paſt, not a word amiſs, or a thought out of order; I find no need of Repentance, or God's pardoning Mercy, or of Chriſt's outward Blood to purify me, who am ſo perfectly clean? <hi>Solomon</hi> gives the ſame Challenge, Who can ſay, <hi>I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my Sins?</hi> his meaning<note place="margin">Prov. 20. 9.</note> is, Who dares ſay it, or can ſay it juſtly? for he tells you there are thoſe that ſay it, yea <hi>a whole Generation who were pure in their own eyes, yet not waſhed</hi>

<hi>Quakers</hi> Failings, that few of them had their minds exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed<note place="margin">P. 10.</note> in Prayer and Meditation; that too many had their Hearts taken up with theſe fading Objects; that they were degenerated into Pride, Height of Spirit and Apparel, contrary to Gravity, Modeſty, Sobriety, Plainneſs, Simplicity, Innocency and Humility. We ſhould con thee thanks,
<hi>George,</hi> for this plain and honeſt Teſtimony, but only we are afraid it dropt from thy Pen unawares; thou didſt not conſider ſure: What, a <hi>Quaker</hi> and confeſs Failings in Friends? Can Infallibility ever trip or ſtumble? Thou didſt not perhaps conſider how thou haſt here expoſed the Friends to the Pit and the Lake, for Brother
<hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs</hi> hath told thee, that God will accept none of them who have any Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: or perhaps thou mayſt think, becauſe <hi>Fox</hi> ſays that Perfection is given to every Quaker in particular, that all theſe Imperfections don't hinder the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of a <hi>Quaker;</hi> or that in them they are no Faults or Failings: and ſo tho thy Teſtimony be very true, we have no reaſon to thank thee for it, yet we ſhould be very glad to hear that when thou prayeſt among thy Friends, thou ſhalt make as frank and open confeſſion of Friends Sins and Failings to God, that you may obtain Forgiveneſs, as you have done to men.</p>
               <p>Now if after all this, the Scripture in ſeveral places ſtile ſome Men perfect, and exhort all thereunto, it ought to be underſtood ſo, as neither to contradict plain Experience, nor other Teſtimonies thereof, which aſſert no Man to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out<note place="margin">Gen. 17. 1.</note> Sin, whilſt he is in this ſtate; and therefore Divines well ſay, that our<note place="margin">Job. 1. 8.</note> Perfection in this Life either refers to Sincerity and Uprightneſs, or to our Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours<note place="margin">Pſal.

Well, let us hear if his meaning be any thing better. God doth not accept Men in their failings in Duty; but by his leave, tho God does not accept Men for their failings, yet he graciouſly accepts them thro Chriſt, whilſt they are under them; and to ſay he does not, is not only to mean, but to ſay the very ſame thing with <hi>Burroughs, That God doth not accept any where there is any failing.</hi> And to ſhew thou fully agreeſt with Brother
<hi>Burroughs</hi> in this, thou haſt commended one of abſolute Perfection to us for our Imitation, who boaſted, when a dying, to his Friends about his Bed, <pb n="28" facs="tcp:102072:19"/> that he was not conſcious of any Action that he had done, that he ſhould be afraid of appearing before Almighty God: it was
<hi>Tudor Brain,</hi> a Lad of about ſeventeen years old; this was even the laſt Breath he drew, and was it not ſweet and edifying? can you imagine how greedily Friends ſuck'd it in as a ſweet ſmelling Savour; how their Souls were refreſh'd and nouriſh'd by it, as a moſt heavenly Expiration? (Poor Child! that had only learnt to parrot ſo preſumptuouſly, as he had been taught a little before by his Parents; neither at Age, God knows,<note place="margin">

<hi>Whitehead</hi> as a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern for us to imitate). A Doctrine that utterly cancels the Goſpel Covenant and its gracious Terms, laying a Milſtone upon our Shoulders that the ſtrongeſt <hi>Sampſon</hi> is not able to bear.
<hi>Whitehead</hi> tells us, there are ſome that complain their beſt Duties are ſinful; but upon the ſtricteſt ſearch, he will hardly find any among us, who hold Duty to be a Sin, <hi>i. e.</hi> that Duty is no Duty. What we hold herein is, That every Duty we perform to God is good, becauſe it is a Duty; but for the manner of its performance, it is not ſo well, but it might be better; ſome chilneſs of Zeal, diſtraction of Thoughts, make a great Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but yet we are accepted therein, thro the Grace of the Goſpel. The old Covenant Terms were ſtrict and rigorous; but 'tis the merciful Condeſcenſion of the Goſpel, ſince we are not ſufficient to pay the whole Debt (and if our Almighty Creditor ſhould exact it, we muſt all to Priſon) to compound with us and accept of what we can, and forgive us if we pay what we are able.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whitehead</hi> ſays, Our Acceptance is in Chriſt, which is very true, but incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with their Doctrine of Perfection; for what need they a Saviour's Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who are not chargeable with any failing, who fulfil the Law and anſwer every demand of Juſtice, as <hi>Burroughs</hi> ſaith, or God will not accept them? their own Perfection ſhall ſpeak for them. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>Who ſhall condemn? it is Chriſt that juſtifieth.</hi> But if <hi>Burroughs</hi> ſay true, and they can anſwer every De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Juſtice, they may ſay 'tis I that will juſtify my ſelf; my own Actions ſhall ſpeak for me; ſurely nothing can condemn, if the Juſtice of God cannot. In citing this Paſſage of <hi>Burroughs, Whitehead</hi> complains we have dropt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what which might have done him a kindneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> theſe words, <hi>But thoſe that love God, keep his Commandments, and they are not grievous.</hi> All which we own, but that his Commandments are not grievous, and his Burden is light, is owing not to our natural Strength and Ability, but to the gracious Terms of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel Covenant, which imparts a larger meaſure of the Spirit to enable the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and alſo accepts Sincerity inſtead of Perfection, which is directly contrary to what <hi>Burroughs</hi> aſſerts here, <hi>viz. That God does not accept any, where there is any failing, who does not fulfil the Law and anſwer every demand of Juſtice,</hi> which Experience, as well as God's Word, aſſure us none is able to do: ſo little do theſe foregoing words contribute towards the rendring thoſe Orthodox, which the <hi>Brief Diſcovery</hi> charges upon him; and if theſe People in particular ſhould pretend above other Men to be without failings, 'twould but make them the more ridiculous, which in this matter they are already even to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>

And the Anſwer was direct enough, <hi>They are as great, and greater too.</hi> But when they prefer their Writings to the Scriptures, he does not, as he tells us, mean the Scriptures, but the <hi>Phariſees</hi> reading them. If the
<hi>Phariſees</hi> were ſuch <hi>A B C-Darians,</hi> that they knew not how to read a Chapter in the Bible as it ought to be; yet the Bible is of the ſame Authority ſtill, read by a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> or an Apoſtle, tho perhaps not of the ſame Efficacy: and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whenſoever ſpoken, or by whomſoever, tho they have not the Spirit who ſpeak them, yet (whatever <hi>Whitehead</hi> ſays in the cloſe of that Paragraph) the Scriptures, by whomſoever ſpoken, we muſt obey, and not, as he ſays, deny.</p>
               <p>In the next Paragraph he bids us note,
<q rend="margQuotes">That the Compariſon is placed upon the Spirit of Truth ſpeaking in Man in the firſt place, and through and by the Miniſters thereof in the next place.</q> A wonderful opening, and amounts to thus much; The Compariſon is placed upon the Spirit of Truth ſpeaking in Man in the firſt place, and in and through Man in the ſecond place: He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes (we ſuppoſe) from hence, as he ſhould have ſaid, the Spirit ſpeaking in and through them, as in and through the Apoſtles, hath not loſt its Authority and Power ſince it gave forth the Scriptures, therefore their Writings muſt be of the ſame Authority with the Scriptures. This were true, if the Spirit ſpake in us or them as through a Trunk (as the Devil did through the Images when he uttered his Oracles) but he ſpeaks in us or them, whilſt he aſſiſts us in our Speakings and Writings; ſo that 'tis not the Spirit, but we that ſpeak and write by the aſſiſtance of Chriſt's Spirit; which aſſiſtance is given us accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what degree our Lord pleaſes (as <hi>Whitehead</hi> acknowledges) to us, in<note place="margin">

To which <hi>G. Fox</hi> anſwers, Then all may ſee now in this, what you received, that hath been from Man, which is not from Heaven immediate, nor the Gifts of the Spirit, nor received the Goſpel by the ſame means the Apoſtles did, who were not the Eye-witneſſes as the Apoſtles were, neither have ye at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to the ſame Knowledg and Underſtanding as the Apoſtles did, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it from Heaven,

'tis another Goſpel they pretend to than ours, their Goſpel being only a manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Chriſt within, his inward Life, Death, Blood, Reſurrection and Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which they pretend to feel, taſte, and ſee within them every day.</p>
               <p>In the cloſe of this Citation, <hi>George Fox</hi> would have all People judg, and ſo would we too, whether it may not be the ſame Goſpel preached now by the Miniſtry of Men, and from Heaven too, that was received by the Apoſtles immediately from God; ſince we give ſufficient evidence, that 'tis the ſame we preach, which we received from them, tho we do not teach immediatly from<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> God, or by Revelation. The Goſpel, he ſaith, is the Power of God, and therefore immediate. 'Tis true, the Goſpel is ſtiled both the Power and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God; and they are immediatly in God, for they are God. But then, that the Goſpel (which had a beginning) is ſo called, is not properly, but figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively, as the Cauſe may be predicated of the Inſtrument; for the Goſpel is an Inſtrument of God's Power and Wiſdom for the Salvation of Believers. It may innocently enough be ſaid, Preaching the Word of God by a lawful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter is the Power of God, becauſe the Power of God makes uſe of this means for the converſion of Thouſands; but then 'tis meant ſecondarily or ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, not originally and ſupremely.</p>
               <p>There is a heavy complaint made for our omitting (after theſe words, <hi>They are in the ſame Power, Underſtanding, Knowledg and immediate Revelation from Heaven, that the Apoſtles were in</hi>) thoſe in the cloſe of the Sentence, <hi>That un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Goſpel;</hi> as alſo thoſe, <hi>And they that be in another cannot underſtand it.</hi> Which amounts to thus much: Every one that underſtands the Goſpel, is in the ſame Power, Underſtanding, Knowledg, and immediate Revelation from Heaven, that the Apoſtles were in; and they that are not can never underſtand the Goſpel; when 'tis evident a man may underſtand the meaning of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel by the help of common Illumination without any ſpecial enlightning, much more without immediate Revelation from Heaven. But this is their general Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent and Opinion: <hi>Geo. Fox</hi> ſays the ſame with
<hi>Whitehead,</hi> not only here, but in his <hi>Journal,</hi> p. 22. and
<hi>Pen</hi> in his <hi>Anſwer to</hi> Faldo, p. 58, 64. Now for the honour of the Scriptures, that they may not ly under the Popiſh Imputation of ſo great obſcurity, we ſhall prove that they who are not in the ſame Power, Underſtanding, Knowledg, and immediate Revelation from Heaven that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles were in, may yet underſtand the ſenſe of the Scriptures in things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Salvation.</p>
               <p>The Scriptures are plain in themſelves; <hi>a Lamp unto our Feet, and a Light unto our Paths,</hi> Pſal. 119. 105. and their Words manifeſt their Senſe to us, as other Writings do, if we have but the uſe of rational Faculties, and the common Illumination of the Spirit of God. And it were contrary to the Goodneſs and Juſtice of God to enact Laws, and make our Obedience to them neceſſary to Salvation; and yet propound them ſo darkly and obſcurely, that none ſhould be able to underſtand them, unleſs they enjoyed the ſame Power, Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, <pb n="33" facs="tcp:102072:21"/> Knowledg, and immediate Revelation from Heaven with the Apoſtles, which to be ſure the greateſt part of thoſe they wrote unto, <hi>viz.</hi> the
<hi>Romans, Corinthians, Galatians, Epheſians,</hi> and others, never did. Beſides, the Scripture obliges all to whom they are delivered to believe and obey, and therefore to underſtand both the Promiſes and Precepts thereof, tho they have not attained to the ſame Underſtanding, Knowledg, and immediate Revelation from Heaven which the Apoſtles had; nay, wicked men, who are far from any ſuch Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and Revelation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are yet bound, if they have the Scriptures, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them, ſince they ſin if they do not; <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 19. <hi>Ye do err not knowing the Scriptures,</hi> ſays Chriſt to the Sadduces; and the conſequence is evident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God never obliges to an Impoſſibility.</p>
               <p>Beſides, they will not ſure deny, but we may underſtand the Scriptures of St. <hi>Whitehead,</hi> St. <hi>Pen,</hi> St. <hi>Fox,</hi> and St. <hi>Burroughs,</hi> without the ſame degree of the Spirit the Apoſtles were acted by; and why not of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St.
<hi>Paul,</hi> who ſure were able to ſpeak as clearly and intelligibly as the former? We under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand well enough what the Friends mean, when they ſay, <hi>Infant Sprinkling is from the Devil, and the Pope;</hi> when they ſay, <hi>the Prieſts are Devils, Dogs, Beaſts, Hirelings;</hi> and many more ſuch Characters drawn to the life by thoſe Artiſts in Railing. See
<hi>Fox, Hubberthorne, Truth's Defence,</hi> and many more. And if we cannot underſtand your Scriptures, why are we invited to read them, who are carnal, deſtitute of the Spirit, of the Spirit we hope they were wrote by?</p>
               <p>Again; Did not <hi>Julian, Celſus,</hi> and <hi>Lucian</hi> underſtand the ſenſe and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scriptures, and many Articles of our Faith contained therein?

               <p>And 'tis as improper to ſay, Ink and Paper are carnal, as a Stone is blind; would it not be a wiſe buſineſs for one to diſcourſe of a carnal Dog, a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <pb n="38" facs="tcp:102072:24"/> Horſe, a carnal Tree, or a carnal Block, as if there were thoſe that could be ſpiritual?

'tis this carnal <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> which has done us all the miſchief, that has chok'd us with this Serpents meat. But
<hi>Fox</hi> tells us, <hi>We Dogs, Serpents, Swine, feed upon the Letter, which is Death;</hi> tho we think 'twas never heard that ever any fed upon the Letters of the Alphabet, and a Bottle of Ink, and took them for his dinner; or how Pen, Ink, and Paper ſhould kill any, unleſs he were ſuch a Fool as to choke himſelf by ſwallowing his Bible.

<hi>Fox,</hi> and <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs</hi>'s writing made of more laſting materials than our Bible? How comes it to paſs then that they are not Duſt, and Death, and Serpents Meat, as well as the Scriptures? No, they are all meſſengers from Heaven, given from the Mouth of the Lord, ſealed with the Eternal Spirit: What care is there to guard the honour of their own Writings (ſee <hi>Snake in the Graſs, p.</hi> 102.) <hi>To you this is the Word of the Lord,</hi> ſays <hi>Fox,</hi> every where of his Scribbles. No, no, yours are not dead, and killing, Serpents Food; they are all Manna, Quail, Honey and the Honey-Comb, our Souls Nouriſhment, as <hi>Coal</hi> ſaid of
<hi>Fox</hi>'s Book; a good ſtomach ſurely he had which could feed ſo ſavourly (as ſome <hi>Africans</hi> are ſaid to do) upon Guts and Garbage, nay on Snakes and Serpents: In the mean time St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Scriptures are but Duſt, Husks, Rottenneſs, ſcarce Dogs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meat. 'Tis true, of late they give the Scriptures better names, but 'tis their cunning Artifice very highly to complement and careſs this Favorite of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, eſpecially when they have ſome Act of Parliament to procure which may tend to their advantage; and when their turn is ſerved, perhaps you may hear of them under their old Character, and they may be as much Serpents Meat as ever. That place, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. which they often quote to depreciate the Letter of Scripture by, is underſtood of the Legal ceremonial Diſpenſation, which the Apoſtles were not made Miniſters of; and in that place the Law is the Letter that killeth, and the Goſpel the Spirit which giveth Life, as will appear plainly to them who attentively read the following Verſes to the end of the Chapter.</p>

We had had a deep ſilence of this thing to this day, had we not had tidings of them in our Scriptures, or ſome other Revelations of them; we could never have known there had been a Spirit of Chriſt, or a Scripture, as they call it, for they dare not call it Trinity, as if there were ſome Magick in that <hi>Latin</hi> word, but from the Scriptures: And if the Light within be the ſame with Chriſt, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt, as <hi>Quakers</hi> ſay, I muſt believe firſt that there is ſuch a Light, ſuch a Chriſt, and ſuch a Spirit of Chriſt (which I cannot do but by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) before I can believe any thing upon their Authority, unleſs I muſt believe a Doctrine upon the Authority of a Rule, of whoſe Being and Exiſtence I have no Evidence ſufficient to induce me to believe it; ſo that the Scriptures only can be the Rule of ſuch a Faith. The Truth is, the Light within is not the Rule, but the rational Sight, or Eye rather whereby we diſcern our Rule, adviſe and conſult with it: How ridiculous would it be to ſay, Chriſt, or the Spirit of Chriſt, is our Rule (who is our Rule) tho his Laws are ſo? he's our Judg, and Guide, rather than our Rule, and he judges and guides us by the Rule and Laws of the Holy Scriptures.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe we are yet at uncertainties where to find that Rule, that we may be guided by it; if the Light within be a guide to us, we would be glad to know whoſe Light it is that hath the honour, whether that Light in <hi>Whitehead,</hi> or <hi>Pen,</hi> or <hi>Burroughs,</hi> or

Then if matters contained in the Scriptures be ſuch a Declaration of the Mind of God, that whoſoever believes and practiſes neither more nor leſs as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation, ſhall be ſaved, then they are a Rule of Faith and Life to them to whom they are given; but they are ſo: <hi>Ergo.</hi> Pſal. 19. 7. <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect;</hi> viz. Such a Declaration as thus bounds us on both ſides, or it could not be perfect if it did not bound us thus, <hi>viz.</hi> give Salvation to him that believes all things it makes neceſſary, and nothing more as ſo: Without doubt the Scripture is ſuch a Rule; according to their agreement or diſagreement to it, all things are right or wrong in Spirituals; for if a Man deviate from it in any thing it makes neceſſary, he's wrong and periſhes; and if he touches it, and ſquares with it in all ſuch Points, he's right, and ſhall be ſaved; hence 2 Tim. 3. 16, 17. <hi>All Scripture is given by Inſpiration from God, and is profitable for Doctrine, Reproof, Correction and Inſtruction; that the Man of God may be perfect, throughly furniſh'd,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Howghil</hi> denys the word (<hi>is</hi>) to be in the Text, he tells us 'tis an addition of the Tranſlator, and it ſhould be thus, <hi>All Scripture given by inſpiration of God, is profitable,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>In a Teſtimony from the Brethren in <hi>London,</hi> met 66 together, ſigned <hi>Farnſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, Parker, Whitehead</hi> (ſee <hi>Brief Diſcovery,</hi> p. 11. l. 5) they ſay,
<q rend="margQuotes">If any difference ariſe in the Church, we declare and teſtify that the Church with the Spirit of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, hath power without the aſſent of thoſe that differ, to hear and determine the ſame; and if any of ours will not ſubmit ſo to be tried, nor ſubmit to the Judgment given by the Spirit of truth in the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Members of the ſame, being conſiſtent with the Doctrine of ſuch good antient Friends as have been and are found in the Faith, agreeable to the witneſs of God in his People, <hi>viz.</hi> the Light within, then we teſtify in the name of the Lord, that he or ſhe is to be rejected and joined with Heathens and Infidels.</q> Mark we pray, if he or ſhe kick againſt their Judgment, conſiſtent with the Doctrine of antient Friends, and agreeable to the Light within: Here is no notice taken of the Scriptures, how agreeable or diſagreeable ſoever it be to them. And <hi>p.</hi> 23.
<hi>l.</hi> 26. yet <hi>Whitehead</hi> hath the face to ſay this makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt them. It ſeems to be a ſmall fault or none with
<hi>G.</hi> to take away the Commiſſion God hath given to the Scriptures to be Judg of Controverſys in matters of Faith. The Queſtion, <hi>G.</hi> is not whether the Church hath any Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in matters of Religion, which is all thou proveſt from <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 17. and we know none deny it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If it be exerciſed about indifferent matters in Diſcipline and Worſhip, we allow her not only a Judgment of diſcretion to diſcern what's fit to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, but alſo an authoritative Judgment to oblige her Members to obedience, or elſe ſhe would have leſs Authority over her Members, than every Maſter hath over the Servants of his Family.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for things that are neceſſary to Salvation, we think our ſelves only obliged to ſubmit our Faith and Practice to the Authority of God in the Holy Scriptures, and not to the Authority of any Church pretending to Infallibility, meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in <hi>Treat</hi> or in
<hi>Gracechurch-ſtreet.</hi> So then that which we find fault with you for, is a profane neglect of Holy Scriptures, in determining matters of Faith or Doctrine: that your Church ſhould cenſure its Members only for this cauſe, that you will not ſubmit to the Authority of the Churches Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, conſiſtent with the Doctrine of antient Friends, and agreeable to the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:102072:33"/> Witneſs of God in them; and that all this while here's not the leaſt mention of the Scripture. The reaſon of Submiſſion to the Doctrine of their Church is, it ſeems, its conſiſtency with the Doctrine of antient Friends, and the Witneſs of God in them. The Judgment of antient Friends, and a whimſical Witneſs called <hi>the Light within,</hi> fetch'd from <hi>Terra incognita,</hi> muſt be ſet upon the Bench, and authoritatively judg and determine all; and the Scriptures muſt be turned out of office for ſome diſſervice ſure they have done the <hi>Quakers.</hi> Accordingly <hi>Keith</hi> was ſentenced as an Heretick, not from Scripture, but from Friends Books: So <hi>Jennings</hi> told him to his Face, He was not to prove his Hereſy from Scripture, but from Friends Books; and the queſtion was not now, who was the beſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, but who the beſt
<hi>Quaker:</hi> and therefore they produced a Book of <hi>W. Pen</hi>'s, inſtead of Scripture, to prove <hi>Keith</hi> an Heretick, and no Chriſtian: And indeed it would be a hard task to prove a <hi>Quaker</hi> to be a Chriſtian, if they had not ſomewhat elſe to prove it by than Scripture. See <hi>G. Keith's Hereſy and Hatred,</hi> printed at

<hi>George,</hi> is all this nothing to the purpoſe, as thou pretendeſt?

               <p>Before we paſs from this point, we muſt mind the Reader, that <hi>G. Keith</hi> was proſecuted in <hi>Penſylvania</hi> for preaching Chriſt without, as well as Chriſt within. Two of their Miniſters witneſs this againſt him, and no other falſe Doctrine was charged upon him. The very truth is, 'tis this Chriſt without us is the only Saviour who ſaves, as by the merit of his Death, ſo by effecting the Graces of the Spirit in us, which are not ſubſtantially and perſonally Chriſt,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:102072:35"/> but called ſo by a <hi>Metonymy,</hi> as the Effect for the Cauſe: And Chriſt is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated of a Chriſt within, and a Chriſt without, univocally; for the Nature of Chriſt is only communicated to the Perſon of Chriſt without, while the Name is only given to Chriſt within, to his Graces and Image, by a Figure. So that here are not two Chriſts; for Chriſt without is only perſonal, ſubſtantial, Chriſt within figurative. There is a King at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and there is a King in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; but not two perſonal Kings, only one that is perſonal, and the other that is figurative, being his Picture only, which is called ſo. And therefore to ſay we are ſaved by another Chriſt than that which is within, does not infer two perſonal and ſubſtantial Chriſts, but a ſubſtantial one and a figurative one, <hi>viz.</hi> his Image, Graces, and Influences, called ſo by a <hi>Metonymy</hi> or a <hi>Metaphor.</hi> And now to ſay, <hi>They are no Miniſters of Chriſt that preach Chriſt without us,</hi> and <hi>The Devil is in thee, if thou thinkeſt to be ſaved by a Chriſt without thee,</hi> and <hi>Devils and Reprobates may make a talk of him without,</hi> are Blaſphemies ſure we can make no blacker by any aggravation. As to what <hi>Geo.

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:102072:35"/> Now Water, and Bread, and Wine are not thoſe, but the outward part of them, which with the inward and ſpiritual Grace make up the Sacraments; and hence they are not carnal but a ſpiritual Ordinance.</q> He tells us again, that <hi>Will.

Good Reader, ſee the <hi>Primmer</hi> as above quoted, The Child's Queſtion was not concerning In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant-Baptiſm, but how it was concerning Baptiſm, Bread and Wine;
<q rend="margQuotes">Why Child, ſays the Father, as to thoſe things (thoſe things ſure were the things in queſtion) they aroſe from the Pope.</q> We matter not what he ſays afterwards, 'tis that place we charge with blaſpheming Water-Baptiſm, an Ordinance of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whitehead</hi> juſtifies <hi>Pen</hi> for ſaying,

                        <hi>P.</hi> 27. l. 3.</note> Circumciſion; he tells us
'tis to be rejected, becauſe it is ſhadowy, and of a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing nature:</q> he knows we do not hold that Water, Bread and Wine are our Sacraments; what then if they periſh, as long as the thing ſignified, which is the beſt part of the Sacrament, does not ſo? By ſuch an Argument we might prove the Paſſover muſt preſently have been aboliſhed, for the Lamb was a periſhing Creature, to be ſlain, and eaten up immediately; but ſure there was ſomewhat ſignified by it that laſted a little longer, even till the coming of Chriſt in the Fleſh, as the thing ſignified by the Elements of our Sacraments will abide till Chriſt's coming to Judgment.</p>
               <p>In fine, one ſays, Baptiſm and our Sacraments are carnal,
<hi>Cain</hi>'s Sacrifice: Another ſays, Baptiſm and our Sacraments were from the Pope: Another, they are no more in force than Circumciſion, and therefore to be laid aſide. Our bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs therefore ſhall be next to prove, they are Ordinances of Chriſt, and the neglect of them is a contempt of an Ordinance of Chriſt, and their ſcurrilous Reflections upon them a blaſpheming Chriſt's Ordinances; and becauſe Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſm is a Sacrament they raiſe moſt and their chiefeſt Arguments againſt, we ſhall ſpeak to that firſt.</p>
               <p>We know the Cry is, Give us plain expreſs Scripture for Water-Baptiſm: Nothing will paſs with them for Scripture proof but what's expreſs. <hi>John Stubs,</hi> in his Epiſtle before <hi>Whitehead</hi>'s
<hi>Divinity of Chriſt,</hi> hath theſe words;
<q rend="margQuotes">Do the Scriptures ſpeak of three Perſons in the Godhead, in theſe expreſs words? let us ſee where it is written; come do not ſhuffle, give us plain Scripture, let us ſee in what Chapter is printed Abſtract, Relative, and Concrete;</q> while it's evident enough that Scripture-Conſequences are as good proof as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Texts of Scripture: Do you think the Lord Jeſus knew how to diſpute with the
<hi>Sadduces,</hi> and prove a Doctrine out of Scripture? Prove if thou canſt, ſay thoſe Cavillers, the Reſurrection of the Dead from Scriptures. Chriſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently proves it out of <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 5, 6. as we find <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 32. where his medium is God's ſaying, <hi>I am the God of</hi> Abraham, Iſaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob. If ſome of thy Brethren had been by, and heard our Saviour offer ſuch an Argument out of Scripture to prove the Reſurrection, would not they have retorted briskly, Good Sir, what's this to the Reſurrection? give us plain Texts of Scripture that the Dead ſhall riſe again: would not they have preſently given it out (tho the <hi>Sadduces</hi> we find had more modeſty) how ſhamefully they had run down and baffled our Saviour; and that he had not a word to ſay for himſelf, not one word of Scripture to confute them with, becauſe he brought nothing but Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture conſequences againſt them. We would know what expreſs Scripture you have for your Negative (as well as for ſeveral other Doctrines) that Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Baptiſm is not an Inſtitution of Chriſt, and yet
'tis a Doctrine that <hi>Quakers</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to be Divine, which yet they only endeavour to prove by Scripture-conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, tho horridly forced and ſtrained. Now let us ſee whether we can offer better to prove our Water-Baptiſm.</p>

               <p>1<hi>ſt.</hi> The firſt Scriptures, for we ſhall here give you two together, are <hi>John</hi> 3. 26. <hi>They came to</hi> John, <hi>and ſaid to him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond</hi> Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, <hi>to whom thou beareſt Witneſs, behold the ſame baptizeth, and all Men come to him.</hi> And, <hi>John</hi> 4. 1, 2. <hi>The Phariſees heard how that Jeſus made, and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized more Diſciples than</hi> John, <hi>tho Jeſus himſelf baptized none, but his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</hi> Here we ſee Water-Baptiſm was inſtituted by Chriſt long before his Death, to be an initiating Ceremony, whereby Jewiſh Converts were admitted into the Society of Chriſtians; ſo that we find our ſelves obliged to prove theſe four things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That it was Water-Baptiſm that was ſpoken of in theſe Texts.</item>

                  <item>4. That all this was done by Chriſt's Command, and ſo was his Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. That 'twas Water-Baptiſm ſpoken of in the
3<hi>d</hi> and 4<hi>th</hi> of <hi>John;</hi> that it was an outward Baptiſm, and not a Baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt, is clear, becauſe the
<hi>Phariſees,</hi> and <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples too took notice of it: ſo that it could not be a thing inward and ſecret, but ſomewhat outward and obvious to mens obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; nay that it was not only outward, but by Water too, is as apparent, becauſe we ſee it in thoſe Texts of St.
<hi>John</hi> compared with <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm: the
<hi>Phariſees,</hi> as well as <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples are here offended, that Jeſus made and baptized more Diſciples than <hi>John,</hi> whoſe Baptiſm was undeniably ſuch. The words in <hi>John</hi> the 4<hi>th</hi> without an Ellipſis, are read thus, <hi>Chriſt baptized more Diſciples than John baptized;</hi> and what reaſon can we have for interpreting
<hi>baptizing</hi> in the laſt place in a different ſenſe from
<hi>baptizing</hi> in the former, eſpecially ſince the exception taken,
<hi>John</hi> the 4<hi>th,</hi> was by the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who neither cared for, nor knew of any other Baptiſm than that of Water? It had been an odd compariſon for a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> Jeſus baptized more with the Holy Ghoſt than <hi>John</hi> did with Water, who had never heard of that ſpiritual Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; and had they heard of it, the <hi>Phariſees</hi> could never have had that honour for our Saviour as to think him ſo Divine a Perſon as to be able to baptize with the Holy Ghoſt, whom they alſo ſo maliciouſly reproach'd and perſecuted.

               <p n="2">2.

Again 'tis evident, <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples and Jeſus's were not the ſame, <hi>John</hi> 1. 35, 37. for two of <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples left him, and followed Jeſus; they being then different Societies, there muſt be a different admiſſion to them. Again, this Baptiſm, as all other Baptiſms were, was uſed as an initiating ſign into a diſtinct Society under another Maſter; the <hi>Jews</hi> that were baptized unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> were <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Diſciples,
<hi>John</hi> 9. 28. and thoſe whom <hi>John</hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized were the Diſciples of <hi>John;</hi> and why ſhould not they whom Jeſus baptized be the Diſciples of Jeſus? 'Tis therefore very idle for the
<hi>Quakers</hi> to ſay, this Baptiſm of Chriſt was the ſame with
<hi>John</hi>'s, and ſo was temporary as his was; they might as well have ſaid, it was the Baptiſm of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Thus have we proved the ſecond, That Chriſt made and baptized Diſciples to himſelf, and not to

He repeats the Command again, becauſe the firſt Commiſſion would not ſerve his purpoſe, ſeeing he was to ampliate and inlarge the Terms; having juſt now laid down his Life for all the Nations of the World, he puts a Clauſe into their Commiſſion now, to inſtruct all Nations in the Rudiments of his new Religion, and then baptize them, that they may be the more capable of the benefit of his Sufferings.</p>

               <p>But why doth St <hi>Paul</hi> thank God he baptized ſo few, if an Ordinance of Chriſt: 'Tis evident he baptized ſome; and if he had not been impower'd by Chriſt to baptize, I would have been preſumption in him to have bapazed any body.

If God had ſaid he never commanded Water-Baptiſm, he was weary of it, his Soul hated it, yet had they found them, they would have proved no more againſt outward Baptiſm, than the other did againſt outward Sacrifices, Come <hi>G.</hi> diſſemble no longer with us, the true Reaſon, if thou wouldſt deal plainly with us, why Water-Baptiſm is rejected by you, is not becauſe the Scripture commands it not, but becauſe you have no Command in your ſelves about it; and as for that Dry, Dead Letter, that Noſe of Wax, the Scriptures, as you call them; no matter what they ſay to us, without ſuch a Revelation: What have we to do with the Command that was to the Apoſtles? They are dead and gone, and the Command of baptizing all Nations died with them. But yet methinks, as the Apoſtles were bid to baptize all Nations, all Nations were required to be baptized, and all Nations are not yet dead, and gone; and therefore there ſhould be ſome left alive, to baptize them, unleſs the Apoſtles were commanded to baptize when dead.</p>

               <p>Thou mayſt remember <hi>George, The Lamb was ſlain,</hi> Rev. 13. 8. <hi>from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World.</hi> He was not actually crucified from the beginning, but the virtue and merit of his Death might reach to the beginning of the World, though not then in being; and why not to the end of it too though not in being? The Purchaſe may be enjoyed either before or after the Payment of the Price; and if it be not in being, we may enjoy the benefit of it by Faith. He asks again, p. 55. whether any thing be of Eternal Merit or Worth, that is not everlaſting; and then ſcoffingly upbraids us, as not being well agreed what Blood of Chriſt we ſhould aſſign that Virtue and Efficacy to, whether to that which was let out of his Side by the Soldier's Spear after Death, or that Blood that drop'd from him in his Agony: and at laſt confidently reſolves, that the Blood of Chriſt that cleanſes us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is the Life of the Spirit, and that this is the Blood of the Covenant. Here we have the outward Blood of Chriſt thrown out of Doors by <hi>Whitehead,</hi> as if it were but the Blood of an Ox or Sheep let out at the Shambles, only becauſe the Scripture ſpeaks ſo much of the Blood of Chriſt, and we muſt not affront its Teſtimony too much: They tell us of an inward Blood of Chriſt, a Blood never heard of before, neither in Scripture, nor any of the Writings of Chriſtians from the Apoſtles times, till Satan in theſe laſt Ages of the World opened a Vein in
<hi>Fox</hi>'s Crown, and ſo furniſhed us with plenty of it,</p>
               <p>Ah how willingly would you be rid of the outward Chriſt, as well as the outward Blood of Chriſt; as the Jews <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 22. they would have thruſt him out of their Synagogues long ere now, but for fear of the People, though in effect they have caſt out Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> as well as his Blood, only dreſt up one as <hi>Michael</hi> dealt with
<hi>Saul,</hi> a counterfeit Phantaſm, as like him as they can, which they call a Chriſt within. Ah <hi>George,</hi> thou wilt one day find it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to have remembred the Blood of Chriſt at our Communion, with Raptures of Joy and Thankfulneſs, than thus to have remembred it in your <hi>Light and</hi>

               <p>God open thy Eyes, and give thee Repentance; for belching out ſuch Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies againſt that Blood, and grant that thou mayſt feel the Virtue of that which thou haſt ſo much vilifyed, and experience the merit of it in the pardon of thy ſo great Blaſphemies.</p>
               <p>What <hi>G.

<q rend="margQuotes">What! Liberty to the Presbyter? No. To the Independent? No. To the Baptiſt? No. Liberty is in the Truth,</q> (which if it has any ſenſe muſt be this; no Liberty to any but thoſe that are in the Truth) equivalent to that of the Papiſts (as the Quotation takes notice) who ſay,
<q rend="margQuotes">What! Liberty to the Sectary? No. To the Hereticks? No. No Liberty out of the Church, ſay they; No Liberty out of the Power, ſays <hi>Fox;</hi>
                  </q> which amounts to the ſame: as one Quaker wrote to another in their bemoaning Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter call'd <hi>the Spirit of the Hat;</hi> which plainly refers to a Liberty from external Coercion and Force, becauſe it ſpeaks of ſuch a Liberty as they could give to, or take away from Presbyters, Independents and Baptiſts. And therefore when <hi>George Whitehead</hi> ſays in anſwer hereunto, there's no true Liberty but in the Power and Spirit of the Lord; and <hi>William Pen</hi> calling it a Spiritual Liberty, is nothing to the purpoſe, Spiritual Liberty being wrought within, not given by Men without, that which no mortal Man can give or take away; neither do Presbyterians, Independants, or Baptiſts (whatever Power the Quakers may come to) fear their Spiritual Priſons, Chains, or Fetters, but their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial ones. And whereas <hi>George Whitehead</hi> ſhifts to another corner, telling us in canting words, 'tis a Liberty in truth; and adds, 'tis for Unity, Society and good Order againſt the Spirit of Strife, Diviſion and Separation: What is this to Presbyterians, Independants, and Baptiſts, who were the perſons ſpoken of? Were they ever taken into your Society, or did they turn Quakers, that you ſhould be concern'd at their making any Diviſion or Separation from you, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of Liberty of Conſcience? All this is to amuſe the Reader, and loſe the true Caſe in hand; which was to ſhow that the Quakers, had they as much Power, would afford as little Liberty to Diſſenters from them, as any of the Perſecuting Prieſts, or Powers of the Earth, as <hi>William Pen</hi> calls them, yea even as the Papiſts themſelves; of which Inſtances enow might be given wou'd it not ſwell this piece too much, which has already exceeded the Limits we deſign'd it: Some are given by the worthy Author of <hi>the Snake in the Graſs,</hi> 3d Edit. <hi>p.</hi> 63, 64, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But we leave this, and proceed to another Head.</p>

<hi>Leyden,</hi> and the reſt of that Gang, had upon the Civil Government of thoſe places they came unto, will acknowledg there's great reaſon to diſcourage ſuch an extravagant Spirit, whatſoever Pretences it makes to prophetick Inſpiration: For how did theſe Propheſies not only lead them into all Impurity (as we have ſhown) but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited the People to run upon their Magiſtrates, and deprive them of all Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Power; and none have followed them more in thoſe pretended Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies and Revelations than the Quakers: and that their's were not ſo influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial upon the Engliſh Nation, as the others were upon <hi>Munſter,</hi> and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is to be attributed to that Sobriety of Temper the greateſt part were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced with, and that Freedom from Arbitrary Oppraſſion the others were liable to; as alſo to their Experience, what a Condition for ſeveral years they had been brought unto by turbulent and unquiet Sects. Our firſt Charge is, That they are Enemies to Kingly Government; and this the Paſſages we quoted from
<hi>Burroughs, George Fox,</hi> and others, did clearly evince; nay, not only their Averſion to Monarchy, but to the Perſon of <hi>King Charles</hi> the

               <p>
                  <hi>Edward Burroughs</hi> ſpeaks thus (<hi>p.</hi> 244.)
<hi>The Lord is riſen to overturn, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn Kings and Princes, Governments and Laws:</hi>—And he will change Times, and Laws, and Governments, and there ſhall be no King ruling but Jeſus, nor no Government of Force, but the Government of the Lamb, nor no Law of Effect, but the Law of God; all that which is otherwiſe ſhall be ground to Powder.

<hi>even contrary to all Men,</hi> and they have given their Power only to God, and they cannot give their Power <hi>to any Mortal Men,</hi> to ſtand or fall by any <hi>outward Authority;</hi> and to that they cannot ſeek, but to the Lord alone. What ſaith <hi>George</hi> to all this? truly he dares not recite it all; but after he had gone a little way, ſtops as if he had ſeen a Spectre. <hi>The Lord is riſen to overturn, to overturn Kings, Princes, Governments and Laws,</hi> and he will change Times, and Laws, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and there he is at a full ſtand, hoping his Reader wou'd never meet with more of it: And thoſe, he ſays (<hi>p.</hi>

<hi>George.</hi> Some of us can well remember to our Sorrow, how
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:102072:43"/> the Lord in his Wrath did then riſe, and for the Puniſhment of our Sins did overturn (by ſuch wicked Inſtruments as the Quakers, who gloried in their having a hand in that overturning-work) Kings, Princes, Governments and Laws. <hi>Edward Burroughs</hi> propheſies, ſays
<hi>George Whitehead;</hi> but 'tis of things paſt, or preſent, which he ſaw accompliſh'd when he wrote them, and there in wiſely caution'd the Quakers (would they have heeded it) never to go beyond their Ken; and had they done ſo, without fooliſhly venturing upon things to come, neither they, nor their Propheſies, had been expoſed to ſo much Shame and Scorn as they have met with.

<hi>Paul</hi> tells us the Wrath of God is revealed from Heaven againſt all ungodlineſs, and unrighteouſneſs of Men; and we have ſo many inſtances thereof from Scripture and our own Experience—But his Prophecy gave little hopes to the Cavaliers, ſince he reminds them therein, that though they had made many attempts to be revenged on their Enemies, they had not proſper'd; the Lord had hitherto always defeated them, and bow'd them down under a People as unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy as others; and <hi>Ch. Stuart</hi> muſt either be converted to God (he was it ſeems at that time wholly eſtranged from him) and ruled by him, or elſe he can never rightly rule for God in this Nation; and then he did believe it was not impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, but that he might be a Rod upon them that had once ſmote him. Who would not travel a great way to be reſolv'd in his Doubts by ſuch a famous Prophet? Truly, had the Oracles of the Heathens been no clearer, or more to the purpoſe than theſe Propheſies, the Prieſts of <hi>Apollo</hi> would have had but a miſerable Trade of it; and yet ſays <hi>Burroughs,</hi> it appears that theſe things, in a great meaſure, were foreſeen and propheſied of.—And yet he preſently after tells them, that his Prophecy was nothing but a rational Obſervation of things; for 'twas, ſays he, verily believed that ſuch a thing would be; your Enemies <pb n="79" facs="tcp:102072:44"/> having ſo acted and proceeded as to deſtroy themſelves, and ſo bring you in over their heads; though they little intended the thing, yet the effect of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings could hardly prove otherwiſe than to deſtroy themſelves, and make room for you; and theſe things I obſerved, ſaith he. So that all the Divine Revelations hereof ſhrunk at laſt into a prudent and rational Gueſs, which he made upon their indiſcreet management and ordering of matters.

And there he ſays, That <hi>George Fox</hi> did foreſee and believe, that he wou'd return as our King un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, which wonderfully agrees with his Uſage of him in theſe Quotations; as the Jews <hi>Hoſannah</hi> in one place, did with their <hi>crucify him</hi> in another. But to be plain, theſe are Paſſages as full of Venom and Poyſon, not only againſt Earthly Kings in general, but the late King <hi>Charles</hi> in particular, as poſſibly could be; for when the Presbyterians joyn'd with the Royaliſts, and God had bowed the Hearts of them all, as the Heart of one Man, to bring back their King, what could be more miſchievous and malicious, than to tell the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians, who were very active in this Affair;
<q rend="margQuotes">That in this they crucified Jeſus, and were Traytors againſt Chriſt; and that the true Elders never went about to ſet up an Earthly King over them to rule, for Chriſt is King alone?</q> And truly our bold <hi>George</hi> (tho daring enough) yet durſt not encounter with this fell and monſtrous Dragon, the very ſight of him daunts his Courage, ſo that he keeps at a prudent diſtance; and tells us only in general, that <hi>Fox,</hi> in rallying thus upon Earthly Kings, meant only ſuch as were perſecuting Kings: Alas! that you ſhould ſo much miſtake my Friend and Brother, <hi>George Fox,</hi> he good Man, made no Reflection herein upon King <hi>Charles</hi> II. tho indeed 'twas he the Prieſts and Presbyterians doated ſo much on, and were ſo deſirous to ſee in
<hi>England</hi> once again; he meant all this only of ſuch as were Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, like <hi>Herod,</hi> who was mad at the Child Jeſus, ſuch Kings as the Gentiles, or Heathens wou'd ſet up, ſuch as <hi>Tophet</hi> of Old was prepared for; I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, he never intended to reflect upon any good Kings; for I have known him ſpeak well, and give good Commendation of our preſent Kings, ſaith <hi>George Whitehead.</hi> A mighty favour, and pity but it ſhould be recorded to Poſterity. Well then; when <hi>Fox</hi> inveighed ſo bitterly againſt Kings, it was only perſecuting Kings he aimed at, ſays his Brother <hi>George Whitehead;</hi> and the ſerious Reader (as he calls him) ought to note, That he has a right to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret his Words the beſt way, as he told him, <hi>p.</hi> 11. But let the World judg of the Folly and Falſhood of ſuch a Vindication, when we have open'd the Charge in all its Branches.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<q rend="margQuotes">To all you, ſays <hi>Fox,</hi> who deſire an Earthly King in <hi>England,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Presbyterians, or others.</q> Here's no mention of a wicked perſecuting King, but an earthly one; neither do we know any, either Presbyterians, or Epiſcoparians, that are very fond of a wicked perſecuting King, tho they can patiently ſubmit, when it pleaſes God for their Sins to place ſuch an one over them.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<q rend="margQuotes">Did the Elders of Old, in the Days of Chriſt, or his Apoſtles (ſaith <hi>Fox</hi>) cry up any King but Chriſt?</q> as if <hi>Paul</hi> had never appealed to one on Earth beſides Chriſt; nay, and Chriſt himſelf had not owned another, and commanded tribute to be paid to him, tho he was a Perſecutor; and Chriſt himſelf was condemn'd to be ſcourged and crucified by his <hi>Vice-Roy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, But <hi>Fox</hi> goes on;
<q rend="margQuotes">the Prieſts and Presbyterians cry up an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly King, and will have <hi>Ceſar.</hi>
                  </q> The Quarrel you ſee, is againſt an Earthly King, not againſt a wicked perſecuring one, or elſe he muſt make them the ſame; and ſo all Earthly Kings are <hi>Nero's</hi> and <hi>Diocleſians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, He adds; “And do they not in this crucify Jeſus? The Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſm of a Chriſt within the Quakers, by defending and upholding our <pb n="87" facs="tcp:102072:48"/> Earthly Kings, we do: Hereby we keep the Quakers Jeſus out of the Throne, which we ſuppoſe is the Crucifixion they mean.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, He proceeds:
<q rend="margQuotes">Are not all theſe Elders, that will doat ſo much upon an Earthly King, Traytors againſt Chriſt?</q> This ſure ſpeaks them to be againſt Kings themſelves, tho never ſo well qualified; for he does not ſay, wicked perſecuting Kings, but only Earthly Kings: ſo that all who obey them, are <hi>Faux</hi>'s and <hi>Catesby</hi>'s, Traytors to King Jeſus: but it would even make an Enemy pity them, to ſee what a miſerable ſhift poor <hi>George</hi> is put to, that he might defend this Clauſe of his Brother <hi>Fox.</hi> He tells us <hi>p.</hi> 29.
<q rend="margQuotes">That we vary in our Citation hereof, from the Author of the <hi>Snake;</hi> we ſaying the Elders, and he the Chriſtians, that will doat ſo much on an Earthly King, are Traytors againſt Chriſt.</q> But could <hi>George Whithead</hi> think to blind his Reader, by throwing ſuch Duſt as this in his Eyes; what injury to the ſenſe and aim of the Quotation is this? eſpecially ſince <hi>George Fox</hi> uſed both the Words; ſaying, Are not all theſe Elders, Chriſtians, that will doat ſo much of an Earthly King, Traytors againſt Chriſt? And our uſing the Word <hi>Elders,</hi> and not
<hi>Chriſtians,</hi> opened a way for thee to eſcape (had it thou diſcern'd it;) for the Scripture tells us of ſuch Elders as were indeed Traytors againſt Chriſt, who wou'd have no King but <hi>Caeſar, Joh.</hi>
19. 15. which no doubt thou wouldeſt have return'd as an anſwer to us, had'it thou been aware thereof: but <hi>Bernardus non videt omnia,</hi> the moſt quick-ſighted ſee not always every thing before them. Let's proceed to the next.</p>
               <p>Sixthly,
<q rend="margQuotes">Do you read (ſays he) That there were any Kings ſince the Days of the Apoſtles, but amongſt the Apoſtate Chriſtians?</q> A moſt infamous Brand upon all the Martyrs, and Confeſſors of old; and upon all the devout Chriſtians in
<hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Days, who are by this ſevere Cenſure, mark'd as Apoſtates, for owning any King but Chriſt, for Chriſt, ſaith he, is King alone; 'tis not perſecuting Kings he here objects againſt, but all Kings whatſoever. Nay,</p>
               <p>Seventhly, He tells us,
<q rend="margQuotes">That is the falſe Church, that doth not live upon the Head of Kings.</q> Then Wee to the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> who teaches her Children to ſit at the Foot, and not ride over the Heads of Kings; and well is it for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who has more than once kick'd off the Crowns of Princes. A moſt excellent, and diſtinguiſhing Note of the true Church, and wou'd do well to be added to the other Notes of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> in the next Impreſſion.
<q rend="margQuotes">For they (ſays <hi>Fox</hi>) here, that are true Elders, never go about to ſet up an Earthly King to rule over them.</q> Which ſhews what Kings are here meant; when he ſaith, That 'tis the falſe Church, that does not live upon the head of Kings, of all Earthly Kings, tho ſome of them may be ſo very devout and religious as to bring their Honour and Glory to the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 21. 24.</note> and be nurſing Fathers to the Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Eighthly,
<q rend="margQuotes">
                     <hi>Herod</hi> the King was mad at the Child Jeſus;—there's the Fruit (ſaith he) of Earthly Kings; they are all a Company of perſecuting <hi>Herods,</hi> who wou'd murder the Child Jeſus if they could, Dragons that ſtand by to devour the Man-child as ſoon as 'tis born; and ſend out a Flood (a Flood of Perſecution) to ſwallow him up.</q> Here is ſuch an <gap reason="foreign">

               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:102072:49"/>
               <p>Ninthly,

               </p>
               <p>Tenthly, Our Friend <hi>George Fox</hi> would have us remember
<hi>Joſhua,</hi> and how he dealt with Kings:
<q rend="margQuotes">Oh! For a <hi>Joſhua,</hi> (a
<hi>Cromwel,</hi> or <hi>Lambert</hi>) what work he made with Kings; he brought them out of the Cave (a fit place for them) to Execution, as we know who was brought out of his Priſon to the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold:</q> A moſt wicked inſinuation, that all our Kings were like the Canaani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Race, which God had marked out for Deſtruction, and fit only to be immur'd in a Cave or Dungeon, or like <hi>Bajazet,</hi> to be ſhut up in a Cage, and never to be led forth but in a Halter.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Fox</hi> tells them,
<q rend="margQuotes">Theſe Kings are the Spiritual Egyptians, got up ſince the Days of the Apoſtles, hard Task-Maſters, under whoſe Bondage we have been held a long time, and ſhall never be freed till a <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſome eminent Quaker (it may be <hi>William Penn</hi>'s Son) undertake our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and lead us to <hi>Canaan;</hi>

<hi>Red-Sea?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now what ſayeſt thou, <hi>George,</hi> to theſe Eleven Articles of Treaſon and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition exhibited againſt thy Friend <hi>George Fox?</hi> We thought 'twould be too fulſom for thee to ſwallow the Charge whole, and therefore have minc'd it, that thou mayeſt taſte the ſweetneſs of it bit by bit. Thus ſpake their Oracle <hi>George Fox,</hi> nor do we paint him in any Colours but what he then appeared in; and let the Reader but impartially weigh both the things and the time they were written in, and ſee if he can make any better of it. But <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi>'s beſt plea is his laſt, <hi>p.</hi> 31. <hi>l.</hi> 19. he tells us theſe Offences were pardon'd by divers Acts of Indemnity. Pray, ſays
<hi>George,</hi> let this be obſerved at laſt <hi>George,</hi> Thou art fain to plead thy Pardon; did ever Man flee to Sanctuary that was not conſcious of his guilt? A Pardon, though it frees from Puniſhment, yet it plainly infers the deſert of it: This <hi>George,</hi> we do obſerve as thou bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt us, and you have found to your comfort, the Government have obſerved it too, neither they nor we have ever gone about to hang you for your former Treaſon; what we deſire is, that you would only ingenuouſly acknowledge the deſert of them.</p>
               <p>And farther, Was it not a ſweet Complement to the Houſe of Lords (a part of the Ancient Government of this Realm) to be ſaluted by the ſame Perſon <pb n="89" facs="tcp:102072:49"/> (writing to the Council of Officers) thus,
<q rend="margQuotes">What a dirty naſty thing is it to talk of a Houſe of Lords amongſt us?</q> Here's the Right Honourable the Houſe of Lords (part of the Fundamental Conſtitution of the Engliſh Nation) beſpattered, and beſmeared by the ſoul Mouth of an inſpired

But notwithſtanding this ſpight they had to the Houſe of Lords, we remember them creeping and ſuing to them, that their
<hi>Yeas</hi> and <hi>Nays</hi> might be taken for an Oath; 'twas, no doubt, a great Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Quakers, that their Word, or upon their Honours, might not be as good a Teſtimony as any Lords of them all, which cannot be forgiven by them that are in the Spirit of their great Apoſtle <hi>George Fox,</hi> who in Conſtruction called them dirty Peers.

                  <hi>Whitehead</hi> tells us this was wrote in the Year 1655, and he appeals to the whole Nation, whether the Tree of the then Government in <hi>England</hi> hath not been cut down and removed. A moſt wiſe and worthy Obſervation, deſign'd if he could to blind the Readers Eyes with; for <hi>Fox</hi>'s Prophecy (as <hi>George Whitehead</hi> calls it, <hi>p.</hi> 34.) was that the Government ſhould be taken from all theſe for Jeſus Chriſt to rule alone: The King that reigned over the Nation was cut down, and all Rulers, Judges, Juſtices, Lawyers, and Conſtables were to be cut down, with the ſame Power which cut down the King, and never to have theſe any more; then we were to have another Earthly King, for Jeſus Chriſt was to rule alone. And we appeal alſo to the whole Nation, whether we have not all theſe Officers ſtill, Rulers, Judges, Juſtices, and Conſtables, every Branch of that fruitleſs Tree (as he call'd it) bleſſed be God, we have them ſpring from a better Root, though he had ſo thoroughly blaſted them with his Thunder. Did <hi>George Fox</hi> deſign hereby to make way for King
<hi>Charles</hi> II. to come and rule over the Nations, in the room of his Father, (who was cut down) and erect the ſame Government, which he had done? we trow not; for the Lord Jehovah was to reign, and Jeſus Chriſt was to rule alone. As for the King who had once reigned over the Nation he was cut off, and by <hi>Fox</hi>'s ſeveral Papers given forth (taken notice of
<hi>p.</hi> 16. of <hi>Brief Diſcovery</hi>) they deſired no more Earthly Kings; and indeed they made no more of Crown'd Heads, than of Quoif-men and Cap-men, whom they pack'd after him.</p>
               <p>Whereas the Quakers preſented a Declaration to K.
<hi>Charles</hi> II. 1660. againſt all Plotters and Fighters, ſaying therein,

<hi>George Keith</hi> and others in <hi>Penſilvania.</hi> It fell out that ſome Pirates took a Sloop of the Quakers, which put them into great diſtreſs how to regain their Sloop, and yet preſerve their Principle of not fighting with Carnal Weapons; but that was impoſſible, as the Caſe now ſtood, and truly they might loſe all their Sloops, and all their Goods too, if they would not oppoſe Force to Force, which at laſt was reſolv'd upon, and by ſo doing, they retook their Sloop, and made ſome of the Pirats Priſoners.
